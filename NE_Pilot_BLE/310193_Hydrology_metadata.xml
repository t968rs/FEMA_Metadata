    <descript>
      <abstract>Hydrology data include spatial datasets and data tables necessary for documenting the hydrologic procedures for estimating flood discharges for a Flood Insurance Study, which include the hydrologic data expected by FEMA for new riverine studies. (Source: FEMA Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping)</abstract>
      <purpose>The objective of this Hydrology data submission is to archive the hydrologic data for a study in a database such that it can be revised and used with the minimum effort in future Flood Insurance Studies or map revisions. </purpose>

      <attraccr>The FIRM Database consists of vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and FIRM Database are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Standards for Flood Risk Analysis and Mapping. Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control and testing of the FIRM Database was also performed.</attraccr>

    <logic>Proven hydrologic methods and/or FEMA approved models are used to compute flows at different locations and for different recurrence intervals (e.g. 1-percent-annual-chance (100-year) event, the 10-percent-annual-chance (10-year), 4-percent-annual chance (25-year), 2-percent-annual-chance (50-year), and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (500-year) event).  Computated flows are compared with historic data and flows established in previous hydrologic investigations to ensure reasonableness.  Flows at the confluence are checked for the possibility of coincident peaks.  Flows exiting the system and regulated by dams are carefully analyzed.  At a given location flows for longer recurrence intervals are larger.  </logic>
    <complete>Flows are computed at different locations of the study area.  The method(s) and/or models(s) are described in the FIS Report.  Assumptions and special considerations are also clearly stated in the report.  Flows previously determined in other studies or hydrologic investigations are used for comparison.  Computed flows are compared with historic flooding data.  Submittal of hydrologic data in accordance with FEMA's Data Capture Technical Reference ensures completeness of the Hydrology Study submittal.  </complete>
