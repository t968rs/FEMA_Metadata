  "metadata/dataqual/attracc/attraccr": "(Modify as necessary) Ground classification routines are used to remove any non-ground points and generate an accurate ground surface. Non-ground points include edge of flight line points which may be geometrically un-usable. These points are identified with the withheld bit and excluded from the automated ground routine. The ground routine consists of three main parameters (building size, iteration angle, and iteration distance); by adjusting these parameters and running several iterations of this routine an initial ground surface is developed. The building size parameter sets a roaming window size. Each tile is loaded with neighboring points from adjacent tiles and the routine classifies the data section by section based on this roaming window size. The second most important parameter is the maximum terrain angle, which sets the highest allowed terrain angle within the model. As part of the ground routine, low noise points are classified to class 7 and high noise points are classified to class 18. Once the ground routine has been completed a manual quality control routine is done using hillshades, cross-sections, and profiles. During the full review of the ground, bridge decks are identified and classified to class 17. After the initial QC steps, a peer review and supervisor manual inspection is completed on a percentage of the classified tiles based on the project size and variability of the terrain. After the ground classification corrections are completed, the dataset is processed through a water classification routine that utilizes breaklines compiled for the project to automatically classify hydrographic features. The water classification routine selects ground points within the breakline polygons and automatically classifies them as class 9, water. During this water classification routine, points which are in close proximity (1*NPS ) to the hydrographic features are moved to class 10, ignored ground. Overage points are then identified with the overlap bit. The fully classified dataset is then processed through a comprehensive quality control program. The data are classified as follows: Class 1 = Unclassified. This class includes vegetation, buildings, noise etc. Class 2 = Ground Class 7 = Low Noise Class 9 = Water Class 10 = Ignored Ground Class 17 = Bridge Decks Class 18 = High Noise 3D breakline elevation attributes derived from a bare earth lidar terrain are applied to bridges and water features (streams and rivers, lakes and ponds, and tidal areas).",
  "metadata/dataqual/logic": "Checks were performed to ensure the data files can be opened, are georeferenced properly, and cover the geographic area completely. Additionally, field survey checkpoints are obtained to evaluate the accuracy of LiDAR products. As specified in the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data, checkpoints in vegetated and non-vegetated areas are tested in a project area. A statistical analysis between the difference in elevations of the field survey checkpoints and LiDAR-derived, bare earth elevations at the same locations provides a quality assessment of the LiDAR data.",
  "metadata/dataqual/complete": "The bare earth surface data is an estimation of the bare earth surface and does not include vegetative and built features. Likewise, it contains estimates of water edges at the time of data collection, and may not reflect current conditions. The bare earth lidar classification will contain voids where above ground features have been filtered out of the ground layer, including beneath buildings, motor vehicles, bridges etc. Voids in the bare earth may also occur where insufficient energy was reflected from the surface to generate a valid return from the terrain. These types of voids in the bare earth surface tend to occur in heavily vegetated areas and over water bodies. Fresh or wet asphalt, wet sand and certain types of vegetation can also cause voids or anomalous elevations. Ground voids are interpolated in the derived terrain and DEM products, unless otherwise specified. The data may have been further processed to reclassify points found to be within delineated water bodies.",
