FEMA approved models are used to compute water surface elevations for required flood events. Computed water surface elevations and topographic data are used to delineate flood hazard boundaries. Roughness coefficients are carefully selected to represent the conditions along stream beds and banks. Hydraulics Data Capture submittals match the model output with respect to floodplain boundaries, cross sections, and water surface elevations and their precision. Floodplain boundaries and cross sections are not cartographically modified, and the data may not necessarily agree exactly with the published regulatory FIRM, FIRM Database, flood profiles, and Floodway Data Tables.",
"metadata/dataqual/logic": "When FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise, flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM may represent rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.",
"metadata/dataqual/complete": "Hydraulic analysis provides water surface elevations at different locations along the stream and for different flooding events. Hydraulic submittal includes key physical data used in the process, model parameters and model output. Data developed in surveying and hydrologic analysis are incorporated in hydraulic analysis. Results of hydraulic analysis are used to map Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) boundaries. Selection of model parameters (e.g., roughness coefficients, expansion and contraction coefficients, etc) is supported by additional information (e.g., landuse, aerial photo, etc). Model boundary conditions are carefully selected and justified. Modeled velocities are checked for potential erosion.",
