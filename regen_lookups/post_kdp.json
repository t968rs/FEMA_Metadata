The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood\n          event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The FIRM Database is\n          derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published FIRMs, flood hazard analyses performed\n          in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published\n          by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n          This file is georeferenced to the Earth's surface using the Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)\n          and North American Datum of 1983.",

In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard\n        Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for\n        flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The FIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on\n        the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The FIRM Database  serves\n        to archive the information collected during the Flood Risk Project."

They must be shown so\n      that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one\n      foot.",

Features may have\n      been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping,\n      FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often\n      transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for\n      communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard\n      areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information\n      obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrologic and hydraulic\n      analysis. Generally, regulatory water surface elevations and/or regulatory floodways are published only for\n      developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur,\n      FEMA may generate flood risk data without published water surface elevations.  Typically, only drainage areas\n      that are greater than one square mile and with an average of one foot of flood depth or greater are\n      studied.",
